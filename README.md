# safeword-hospitality-generator
The idea of this project is to easy generate a pdf with a safeword, so public places can use
this to improve customer care and help their customers in difficult situations.

This is often used in a situation where a customer gets bothered by someone and with these safewords the customer can attend employees of the situation.  
This will improve the safety of the customers and provides a better overall experience
